        <p>Welcome to Life Study of Joel</p>

<p>B. To Recompense the Nations' Mistreatment
of Israel during the Great Tribulation
The purpose of Christ's judgment upon the living will be to recompense the nations' mistreatment of Israel during the great tribulation (vv. 2b-8; Rev. 12:17; 13:7, 10; Matt. 25:41-46a). After Christ casts Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire, He will set up His throne in Jerusalem, and all the living ones as the goats and the sheep will be gathered before Him to be judged by Him. The goats will be the evil ones, those who persecuted the Jews, and the sheep will be the good ones, those who helped the persecuted Jews during the tribulation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Accompanied by the Natural Calamities
of the Sixth Seal and the First Four Trumpets
God's saving of Israel by pouring out His Spirit upon them will be accompanied by the natural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12) on the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth (Joel 2:30-31a) as a prelude to the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21).</li>
<li><p>Before the Fifth Trumpet,
the First of the Three Woes
The second outpouring of the Spirit for the saving of the returned Jews will take place before the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes (Rev. 8:13—9:19; 11:14; 15:5—16:21), which are the major structure of the great tribulation, in the great and terrible day of Jehovah (Joel 2:31b). However, many of the returned Jews will not believe but will continue to be stubborn. Eventually, during the tribulation, Jerusalem will be surrounded by the Gentile armies under Antichrist, whose intention will be to destroy Israel entirely. At that juncture the Lord Jesus Christ will descend with His overcomers. Furthermore, according to Zechariah 12, at that time the consummated Spirit will again be poured out, and the remnant of the children of Israel will be saved.
Thus, there are three outpourings of the Holy Spirit: first, the outpouring on the day of Pentecost; second, the outpouring just before the great tribulation upon the Jews; and third, the outpouring upon the besieged Jews, who will have no way to escape the persecution of Antichrist. These three outpourings work together for the salvation of Israel.</p></li>
<li>
<p>By Pouring Out His Spirit upon Them
Jehovah is willing to save Israel by pouring out His Spirit (as the former rain) upon them (vv. 28-29). This prophecy was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 16-21), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste before the great tribulation for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This outpouring is different from the outpouring of the Spirit on the last day of the tribulation (Zech. 12:10) for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist's besieging.</p>

<ol>
<li>Satan Being Bound for a Thousand Years
and Cast into the Abyss
Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). This will take place after Christ deals with Antichrist and his armies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Christ Ruling the Nations
with an Iron Rod for One Thousand Years
Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod for one thousand years and will break them in pieces as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces (Rev. 2:27).</li>
<li>The Burning of the Rebellious People
and the Casting of the Devil into the Lake of Fire
At the end of the millennium, the nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against Christ, but fire will come down out of heaven and devour them. Then the devil will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10).</li>
<li>
<p>The Judgment of the Great White Throne
At the end of the day of the Lord, there will be the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15) by Christ over the dead men, the demons, and probably the fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4).
E. The Heavens and the Earth Being Renewed
Finally, the heavens and the earth will be renewed with intense burning heat to be the new heavens and the new earth for the New Jerusalem (2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 21:1-2). The day of the Lord ends with this burning heat. The heavens and the earth, the old creation, have been polluted and contaminated by Satan's rebellion and by man's fall and therefore need to be renewed.
The day of the Lord with all of its judgments is for the manifestation of Christ. As we study the Bible, we need to realize that revelation in the Bible is centered on Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God's economy. All the judgments of the day of the Lord, including all the calamities, plagues, and woes, have a goal, and this goal is to bring in the manifestation of Christ.</p>

<p>g. The Unprecedented Earthquake of the Seventh Bowl
In the seventh bowl there will be an unprecedented earthquake. The great city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts, the cities of the nations will fall, and political Babylon will be destroyed under God's wrath. Every island will flee, and the mountains will disappear. Furthermore, great hail will come out of heaven upon men (Rev. 16:17-21).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the Calamities, Plagues, and Woes
from the Sixth Seal to the Seventh Bowl
Constituting the Great Tribulation,
the Hour of Trial
All the calamities, plagues, and woes from the sixth seal to the seventh bowl constitute the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), the hour of trial to try all the people who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). The great tribulation will last for three and a half years (Rev. 11:2; 12:14; 13:5; 12:6).
a. The Religious Babylon the Great Being Destroyed
Probably at the beginning of the great tribulation, the religious Babylon the Great, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist (Rev. 14:8; 17:16). At the end of the great tribulation, the political Babylon the Great, the revived Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the Lord.
b. The Two Witnesses
In the great tribulation the two witnesses will spit fire out of their mouth to devour their enemies, will shut up the heavens from raining, will have authority to turn the waters into blood, and will smite the earth with every plague (Rev. 11:3-6).
c. Antichrist Blaspheming God
and Making War with the Saints and Overcoming Them
In the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Antichrist, instigated by Satan and strengthened by the false prophet, will blaspheme God and make war with the saints and overcome them. Satanic authority will be given to him over every tribe and nation (Rev. 13:4-7; 12:13-17; 2 Thes. 2:3b-4; Dan. 11:36-39; Matt. 24:15).</p>

<ol>
<li>The Third Woe, the Seventh Trumpet
The third woe, the seventh trumpet, will be composed of the seven bowls (Rev. 11:14-15a; 15:1, 5-8; 16:1).
a. The Evil and Malignant Sore of the First Bowl
The evil and malignant sore of the first bowl will be upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image (Rev. 16:2).
b. In the Second Bowl the Sea
Becoming Blood like That of a Dead Man
In the second bowl the sea will become blood like that of a dead man, and every living soul that is in the sea will die (Rev. 16:3).
c. In the Third Bowl
the Rivers and Springs Becoming Blood
In the third bowl the rivers and springs will become blood to be the drink of those who pour out the blood of the saints and the prophets (Rev. 16:4-7).
d. In the Fourth Bowl the Sun Burning Men with Fire
In the fourth bowl the sun will burn men with fire (Rev. 16:8-9).
e. In the Fifth Bowl
the Kingdom of Antichrist Becoming Darkened
In the fifth bowl the kingdom of Antichrist will become darkened, and people will gnaw their tongues for pain and will blaspheme the God of heaven for their pains and sores (Rev. 16:10-11).
f. In the Sixth Bowl There Being
the War of Armageddon
In the sixth bowl there will be the war of Armageddon, in which Antichrist and his armies will fight against Christ with His overcomers. Christ will destroy Antichrist and all his evil armies, and Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 16:12-16; 17:14; 19:19-21). In Revelation 14:17-20 Christ's defeating Antichrist and all his evil armies is likened to His treading of the great winepress of the fury of God.</li>
</ol>

<p>D. The Final Day of Jehovah (the Lord)
Beginning at the Sixth Seal
and Ending at the Judgment
of the Great White Throne
The final day of Jehovah (the Lord) will begin at the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17), end at the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15), and comprise various calamities, plagues, and woes for the Lord's punishing judgments and governmental dealings upon the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, men, Satan, and the demons to clear up the earth and the entire universe, for the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1) to come for His eternal kingdom. The time from the sixth seal to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom will be a little more than three and a half years. That will be the time mainly of the great tribulation. The judgment of the great white throne will take place after the thousand-year kingdom. Thus, the day of the Lord will last for about one thousand three and a half years.
Let us now briefly consider the calamities, plagues, and woes which the day of the Lord will comprise.</p>
</li>
<li>The Natural Calamities of the Sixth Seal
First, there will be the natural calamities of the sixth seal upon the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens, and the earth.</li>
<li>The Severer Calamities
of the First Four Trumpets
Revelation 8:7-12 speaks of the severer calamities of the first four trumpets upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars. Actually, the calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are a cluster related to the judgment of the universe.</li>
<li>The First Woe, the Fifth Trumpet
The first woe, the fifth trumpet, will be by the locusts from the abyss under Antichrist as their king, who will also come out from the abyss (Rev. 9:1-11).</li>
<li>The Second Woe, the Sixth Trumpet
The second woe, the sixth trumpet, will be by the four angels released from the Euphrates with the two hundred million horsemen (Rev. 9:12-19).</li>
</ol>

<p>C. The Day of the Lord
Being the Day in Which the Lord Judges
Before the Lord comes, it is "man's day," in which man judges (1 Cor. 4:3-5). Man will continue to judge until the Lord comes. After the Lord comes, it will be "the day of the Lord," in which the Lord judges. Man's day of judgment is the present age. This is in contrast to the Lord's day, which is the coming age, the kingdom age, in which the judgment will be the Lord's judgment. Today in the day of man, everyone is a judge. Even children judge their parents, and students judge their teachers. But in the day of the Lord, the Lord will stop all human judging and will give the final word.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In His Judgment of the Nations
In this book Christ is revealed also in His judgment of the nations (3:2a, 12, 14). This is the judgment of the living (Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 10:42; 17:31). Acts 10:42 tells us that Christ is the One who has been designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead, and 17:31 says that God "has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated." Christ will judge the living just before the millennium and He will judge the dead after the millennium.</p>

<p>GOD GENTLY CAUSING US TO EAT
A third implication concerning Christ is found in Hosea 11:4b. Here Jehovah says, "I was to them like those/Who lift off the yoke on their jaws;/And I gently caused them to eat." When did God do this? During the forty years the children of Israel were in the wilderness, God gently and patiently fed them with manna. Manna is a type of Christ as our heavenly food. Hence, this word concerning God's gently causing them to eat also implies Christ.
When we were saved, God drew us with cords of a man, with bands of love, and now He is feeding us with Christ. I can testify that from the time I was saved God has been gently and patiently feeding me with Christ. Sometimes we may want to eat too much or eat in haste, but God wants us to eat slowly and gently with patience and endurance. This is the way God feeds us.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>CORDS OF A MAN, BANDS OF LOVE
Hosea 11:4a says, "I drew them with cords of a man,/With bands of love." God's love is divine, but His love reaches us in the cords of a man.
It is important for us to realize that this verse does not speak of a cord but of cords. These cords include Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This means that the cords mentioned in this verse have different segments and that each segment involves Christ's humanity. First, God was incarnated; He came to be a man named Jesus. Incarnation, therefore, is the first segment of the cords of a man. The Lord Jesus lived among us on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His human living is the second segment of these cords. Eventually, He was crucified, dying on the cross for us, and then He was resurrected. His crucifixion and resurrection are also segments of the cords of a man. It is with such cords that God has drawn us.
We have pointed out that every segment, every part, of the cords of a man involves Christ's humanity. After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens in His humanity. This was the reason Stephen could see the ascended One as the Son of Man and testify, saying, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56). When Christ comes back, He will come in His humanity. The Lord's word to the high priest in Matthew 26:64 reveals this. "From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven." The cords of a man, therefore, involve Christ's humanity in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
In Hosea 11:4a "cords of a man" and "bands of love" are in apposition. Hence, the words "cords" and "bands" refer to the same thing. The bands of love are the cords of a man. The love of God, the divine love, comes to us through Christ's humanity. For this reason, the bands of love are the cords of a man. Here Christ is revealed not directly but by the way of implication. What a rich, deep, marvelous, and mysterious implication concerning Christ we have here!
God's everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love, is altogether in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. Apart from Christ God's everlasting love could not be prevailing. God's unchanging love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. If Christ had not been incarnated, if Christ had not lived on earth, if Christ had not died a vicarious death for us, if Christ had not entered into resurrection and then ascended to the heavens, there would be no way for God to draw us with cords of a man, with bands of love.
We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all for us, for it is by all these steps of Christ's humanity that God's love in His salvation reaches us. These steps are the cords of a man, the bands of love, with which God has drawn us.</p>

<p>The Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son
Regarding Christ as the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God. In eternity, Christ was God's only begotten Son (John 1:18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). Christ was the unique Son of God. Besides Him there were no other sons of God. How, then, can there be the many sons of God? To answer this question we need to consider Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. One day Christ, the only begotten Son of God in eternity, was incarnated to be a man. On the cross He died an all-inclusive, vicarious death, and then He entered into resurrection. In resurrection and through resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. As the only begotten Son of God in eternity, Christ did not have humanity; He only had divinity. Therefore, before His resurrection He was the Son of God only in His divinity. That was unique. But by His incarnation He entered into humanity and took on human nature as part of His being. However, He was not designated the Son of God in His humanity (Rom. 1:4) until His resurrection. This is the reason that Paul says in Acts 13:33, "God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You.'" This verse indicates that resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus. He was begotten of God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). This means that, in addition to His being the unique, only begotten Son of God from eternity, Christ, after incarnation and through resurrection, was begotten of God in His humanity to become the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God.
The Many Sons
The word "Firstborn" in Romans 8:29 and Hebrews 1:6 indicates that God has many sons. Without the many sons Christ could not be the firstborn Son; He could only be the only begotten Son. In order for Christ to be the firstborn Son, there must be other sons. These other sons were also born in Christ's resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). This means that in His resurrection not only was Christ born to be the firstborn Son of God, but also in His resurrection we were regenerated and born to be the many sons of God, His many brothers, to be His members for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ. All this is implied in Hosea 11:1. How rich are the implications in this verse!</p>

<p>CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD,
BEING CALLED OUT OF EGYPT BY GOD
Hosea 11:1 says, "When Israel was a child, I loved him,/And out of Egypt I called My son." This verse implies Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God and as the One called out of Egypt by God. The fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in this verse is in Matthew 2:15, which speaks of Christ's being called out of Egypt by God. Thus, Hosea 11:1 implies Christ as the Son of God.
A further implication of this verse is that with Christ we, the believers in Christ, are also sons of God (Heb. 2:10). In Christ we are sons of God. Apart from Christ we cannot be sons of God. Our sonship (Eph. 1:5) is altogether in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ.</p>

<p>Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people. A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son. As a son grows, he is transformed. Our relationship with God is of the divine, eternal life of God. This life enlivens us, regenerates us, sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally, renews us, transforms us, conforms us, matures us, and glorifies us, making us the same as God in life, nature, appearance, and glory.</p>

<p>In verses 4 through 8 we have a picture of Israel in the restoration (Matt. 19:28), as revealed in Hosea 2:15-23; 3:5; 6:1-3; 10:12. Jehovah will heal their apostasy; He will love them freely, for His anger will have turned away from them. He will be like the dew to Israel. Israel will bud like the lily (signifying a pure life trusting in God) and will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon (signifying standing steadily in the uplifted humanity). His shoots will go forth (signifying flourishing and spreading); his splendor will be like that of the olive tree (signifying glory in faithfulness); and his fragrance will be like that of the trees of Lebanon (signifying the sweet odor of a life in the uplifted humanity). Those who sit under his shade (signifying being overshadowed by the sufficient grace enjoyed by them—2 Cor. 12:9) will return. They will revive like grain (signifying being full of life for producing the satisfying food) and will bud like the vine (signifying blossoming for producing the cheering drink). Israel's renown will be like the wine of Lebanon (signifying a good name spreading like tasteful wine).
I hope that this will be the situation with all the local churches in the Lord's recovery. Then instead of being an unturned cake or a silly dove or a deceitful bow, we will be like lilies, trees of Lebanon, olive trees, and budding vines.</p>

<p>Verse 4a says, "I drew them with cords of a man,/With bands of love." The phrase "with cords of a man, with bands of love" indicates that God loves us with His divine love, not on the level of His divinity but on the level of His humanity. God's love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God's love is divine but on a human level. If He loved us on the divine level, we could not touch His love. His divine love reaches us on a human level. He has come down to the human level in order to reach us. This is what it means to say that He drew Israel with the cords of a man, with bands of love.</p>

<p>The second emphasis in the book of Hosea is the evils of Israel as the unchaste wife of Jehovah. Once a wife becomes unchaste, all kinds of evils follow. Once we forsake God, we too can do any kind of evil. As the unchaste wife of Jehovah, Israel was stubborn in her unchastity. This stubbornness is described in detail in chapters eleven through fourteen. These chapters also reveal Jehovah's unchanging love, and this is what we will consider in this message.
II. JEHOVAH'S UNCHANGING LOVE
A. Jehovah Loving Israel When Israel Was a Child,
and out of Egypt Jehovah Calling His Son
Hosea 11:1 says, "When Israel was a child, I loved him,/And out of Egypt I called My son." Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah throughout the book of Hosea. But when God's everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God's son (Exo. 4:22-23), indicating that Israel has the Father's life. Only real sons, not adopted sons, have their father's life. Hosea 11:1 also indicates that Christ joined Israel to be the Son of God and that He was called out of Egypt by God (Matt. 2:13-15).
God's everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son. Love toward a wife is love in affection, but love toward a son is love in life. On the one hand, God loves us as His wife, and the Lord Jesus is our Husband. On the other hand, God is our Father, and we are sons of the Father.</p>

<p>A. God's Prophets Calling Them
God sent the prophets to call Israel again and again, but the more the prophets called them, the farther they went away from the prophets. "As they called them,/So they went from them;/To the Baals they sacrificed,/And to the idols they burned incense" (11:2). They served the Baals with their offerings of sacrifices.
From the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70 until now, God has not raised up any prophets among the Jews. This is God's doing. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that "the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit." This nation is the church. In the church God has raised up many prophets. Furthermore, in the church every reborn one is a priest (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). As long as we are children of God, we are priests. In addition to being God's priests serving Him in the gospel (Rom. 15:16), we all need to endeavor to prophesy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy (vv. 1, 39) and said that we all can prophesy one by one (v. 31). The Lord has shown us that, in His recovery today, He wants to recover 1 Corinthians 14, that is, to recover the prophesying of every believer. Every Lord's Day, after remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father at the Lord's table, all the members of the church should prophesy. This means that they all should speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. If we all, the young ones and the old ones, prophesy one by one, how rich, how high, how fresh, how living, and how powerful that would be! We all must honor God's ordained way in 1 Corinthians 14. We were regenerated to be priests. Now we need to endeavor to prophesy.</p>

<p>Verses 12 and 13 say, "Sow unto righteousness for yourselves;/Reap according to lovingkindness;/Break up your fallow ground;/For it is time to seek Jehovah/Until He comes and rains/Righteousness on you./You have plowed wickedness;/You have reaped injustice;/You have eaten the fruit of lying./For you have trusted in your way,/In the multitude of your mighty men." This is similar to what Paul says in Galatians 6:7 and 8, where he tells us that if we sow unto the flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life. Here in Hosea 10:12 to sow means to seek Jehovah. To seek Jehovah rightly is to sow rightly. Thus, Hosea charged the children of Israel to sow unto righteousness. If they did this, they would reap according to lovingkindness. Otherwise, if they plowed wickedness, they would reap injustice.
In verse 12 Hosea uses the expression "fallow ground." Fallow ground is ground that has been plowed but has not been sown with anything. The children of Israel were the fallow ground. They had been plowed by God, but had not been sown with righteousness. They were to break up the fallow ground; that is, they were to seek God until Christ came as righteousness to rain righteousness upon them.
However, Israel did not sow properly. They trusted in their own way and in the multitude of their mighty men. Therefore, God caused them to be utterly destroyed. Regarding this, verses 14 and 15 say, "A tumult will arise among your peoples; /And all your fortresses will be devastated,/As Shalman devastated Beth-arbel/In the day of battle:/The mother was dashed in pieces with the children./Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you/Because of your great evil: /At dawn the king of Israel/Will be utterly cut off." This was fully fulfilled by Titus in A.D. 70.
The word "dawn" in verse 15 indicates that Israel was in the night, in darkness. They were a people who were altogether lacking in righteousness and justice. They forsook God and they were evil to one another.</p>

<p>Verse 3 says, "For now they will say,/We have no king,/For we did not fear Jehovah;/And the king, what can he do for us?" Because they did not fear Jehovah, they could not have God's deputy authority (a king). This refers to the headship, the leadership, among God's people. When the church is proper, the church has the headship, the leadership, representing God as His authority. But in a time of turmoil, some would say, "Why do we need God's deputy authority? Why do we need to have any headship or leadership?" This issues in anarchy.</p>

<p>t for God but for themselves.
VI. THEY NOT PARTICIPATING
IN THE DAY OF ASSEMBLY
AND IN THE DAY OF THE FEAST OF JEHOVAH
Verse 5 indicates that they would not participate in the day of assembly and in the day of the feast of Jehovah. They did not care for the feast of Jehovah but only for their own necessities, enjoyment, and pleasures.</p>

<p>II. ISRAEL HAVING GONE
AS A HARLOT AWAY FROM HER GOD
Israel was told not to rejoice, for she had gone as a harlot away from her God. She had loved payment, like a harlot, upon every grain floor, worshipping idols on every threshing floor (9:1). The threshing floor was a place where people earned their living. Thus, they worshipped idols in the place where they earned their living.
III. THE THRESHING FLOOR
AND THE WINEPRESS NOT FEEDING THEM
Verse 2 says that the threshing floor and the winepress would not feed them, and the new wine would fail them. Whatever they had would not be sufficient to take care of their need. They would desire wine to drink, but there would be none.</p>

<p>b. A Silly Dove
Verses 11 and 12 say, "Ephraim has become like a silly dove/Without understanding:/They call to Egypt;/They go to Assyria./When they go,/I will spread My net over them; /I will bring them down like the birds of heaven;/I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly." Israel's being likened to a silly dove symbolizes that they were lacking the proper knowledge of God in His economy. Many of today's Christians are lacking the knowledge of God's economy. They do not realize that God's present chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations will issue in the manifestation of Christ to bring in the restoration.
c. A Deceitful Bow
In verse 16a Israel is likened to a deceitful bow. This symbolizes that they were rebellious toward God and were not faithful to fight the battle for God's kingdom.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Adultery Practiced by All of the People
Adultery was practiced by all of the people. They burned like an oven in their lust, devouring their judges (the priests) and making all their kings fall (vv. 4, 6-7). Hosea used the parable of a baker to portray Israel's burning lust. Even the kings could not stand against the burning lust within them.</p></li>
<li><p>A Word concerning Coming
and Returning to Jehovah,
Who Will Heal Them and Bind Them Up
In 6:1 we have a word concerning Israel's coming and returning to Jehovah. In this verse the prophet says, "Come and let us return to Jehovah,/For He has torn us, but He will heal us,/And He has stricken us, but He will bind us up."</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Jehovah will lure Israel, He will bring her into the wilderness, and He will speak to her heart (v. 14). The wilderness should signify a wild place. During the Second World War Hitler made Germany a wilderness for the Jews, and today the Arab countries are trying to make the nation of Israel a wilderness. God would allow even this, for in the wilderness God can speak to Israel.
Quite often in our human life we enter into a situation which may be likened to a wilderness. Sometimes God will cause our environment to be a wilderness so that He may speak to us, to our heart.</p>

<p>"Then Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman who is loved by her companion yet who is an adulteress, even as Jehovah has loved the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes" (v. 1). Here Jehovah told Hosea to love Gomer, a woman of adulteries, again. This symbolizes that Jehovah will love the children of Israel again, though they have turned to other lovers (other gods) and loved raisin cakes (pleasures for self). Apparently, God stopped loving Israel when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and again when Titus the prince of Rome destroyed Jerusalem. To this day Israel has been left alone, apparently without God's love, yet God still cares for Israel in His own way.</p>
